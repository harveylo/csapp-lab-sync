the bomb can not get the proper input

# Phase 1:

Enter: `Border relations with Canada have never been better.`

# Phase 2:

Enter six numbers, where the first number must be 1, and each subsequent number is twice the previous number.

# Phase 3:

2 or more numbers, the first number must be a natural number less than 8.

The second number should be a specific number depending on the first number entered:
- 207(0xcf), if the first number is 0.
- 311(0x137), if the first number is 1.
- 707(0x2c3), if the first number is 2.
- 256(0x100), if the first number is 3.
- 389(0x185), if the first number is 4.
- 206(0xce), if the first number is 5.
- 682(0x2aa), if the first number is 6.
- 327(0x147), if the first number is 7.

more numbers can come after the second number, but they does not affect the result.
